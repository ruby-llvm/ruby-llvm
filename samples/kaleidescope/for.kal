# no brackets after for, start = value (expression) , condition , optional step 
# and then "in" and the body
# the body is actually a single statement. In mandel we define the : operator for chaining

# put is defined in driver to cast to int and print to stdout as a char  
# ps: this is not possibly in kaeidescope and done in c in the original tutorial.

# print out 0 to 9
